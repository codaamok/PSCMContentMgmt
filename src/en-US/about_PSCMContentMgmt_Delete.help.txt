    about_PSCMContentMgmt_Delete

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the functions in PSCMContentMgmt used for deleting
    content from distribution points or distribution point groups.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    As mentioned in about_PSCMContentMgmt, some functions in PSCMContentMgmt
    are wrappers for cmdlets in the Configuration Manager module.

    These functions are good examples of that. However the main benefit
    is pipeline support. This enables you to quickly take action with certain
    tasks.

    With the exception of Invoke-DPContentLibraryCleanup, this is a wrapper
    for the ContentLibraryCleanup.exe binary.

COMMANDS
    * Remove-DPContent
        Removes content objects from a given distribution point.

    * Remove-DPGroupContent
        Removes content objects from a given distribution point group.

    * Invoke-DPContentLibraryCleanup
        As previously mentioned, this is simply a wrapper for the Content
        library clean up tool.
