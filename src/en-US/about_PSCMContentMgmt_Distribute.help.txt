    about_PSCMContentMgmt_Distribution

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the functions is PSCMContentMgmt used for distributing
    content to distribution points or distribution point groups.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    As mentioned in about_PSCMContentMgmt, some functions in PSCMContentMgmt
    are wrappers for cmdlets in the Configuration Manager module.

    These functions are good examples of that. However the main benefit
    is pipeline support. This enables you to quickly take action with certain
    tasks.

COMMANDS
    * Start-DPContentDistribution
        Initiates distribution of content objects to a given distribution
        point.

    * Start-DPContentRedistribution
        Initiates redistribution of content objects to a given distribution
        point.
        
        This differs from Start-DPContentDistribution in that
        this function redistributes content that has been previously
        distributed to the distribution point, regardless of that content
        object's distribution status (success, retrying or failed).

        Start-DPContentDistribution can only distribute content objects to
        distribution points where said content object is not returned from
        Get-DPContent (in other words, in the Content tab of the
        distribution point's properties).

    * Start-DPGroupContentDistribution
        Initiates redistribution of content objects to a given distribution
        point group.
